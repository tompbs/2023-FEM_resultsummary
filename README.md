## My process

On this challenge I focused less on the exact matching of the design to focus on writing a js code in the functional paradigm.
I've been using the help of ChatGPT for most of the work - such a great ressource to learn!

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript

### What I learned

TBD...

### Continued development

For the next project I want to try larger designs not just an element.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - This helped me along the way to learn new functions, improve my code, breakdown some code, manage errors.
